Project Steps:

*Data Understanding:
Load and explore the dataset, identifying its structure, features, and data types.

*Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
Handle missing values, outliers, duplicates, and perform necessary data transformations like normalization/standardization.

*Data Merging:
If additional datasets are available, merge them with the main dataset.

*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Use statistical methods and visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships.
Feature Engineering:
Generate new features if required to improve model performance.

*Ad Hoc Analysis:
Perform specific analyses to derive deeper insights from the data.

*Forecasting:
Use machine learning models like ARIMA or LSTM for forecasting trends such as supply chain demand or costs.

*Machine Learning Modeling:
Apply classification, regression, or clustering techniques to the data, evaluating model performance with appropriate metrics.

*SQL Integration:
Use SQL queries for operations like joins, aggregations, and filtering to manipulate the data.

*Visualization:
Create interactive dashboards and visualizations using tools like Tableau or Python libraries.

*Documentation & Presentation:
Properly document your process, analyses, and findings, then present the results in a clear and structured manner.
